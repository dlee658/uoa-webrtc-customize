# WebRTC Conference Call
This application has been developed to conduct a study on the factors that contribute to user participation in remote learning through video conferencing tools at universities.
The motivation of the study was due to the lack of video sharing of participants (students) which has made it more difficult for hosts (lecturers) to communicate and receive visual feedback from the participants. 

User story: 
Selective video sharing: For students, that doesn't mind sharing their video to the lecturer or guest speaker during online lectures but feels nervous and anxious about the whole class staring at them.

Selective audio sharing: For asking quick questions between lecturers, tutors or students that may not require broadcasting to all users.

This application aims to improve the experience for users by implementing selective video and audio sharing.
This demo is ideal for no more than 5 devices.
